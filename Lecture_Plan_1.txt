1) Introduction of Data Science, Importance of Python Programming

2) Python

3) EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
- Sample, and Population
What do you do with the data 
- Present it visually - Scatter plot, Box Plot, Heatmap, Histogram, Barplot, Density Plot
- organise, summerize, and make inferences

EDA - for gaining a better understanding of the data
aspects like :
- Main features of data
- Variables and relationship that hold between them
- identifying which variables are important for our problem

EDA is statisticans way of story telling

Types of Data
- Qualitative - True/False, yes/no, bad/good/best, data of address etc
- Quantitive - numerical data - 1,2.2,4

Descriptive Statistics
- Measures of central tendency
  - Mean = sum / no of data
  - Median = Value at half index of a sorted data, mode = value that present max no of times.
  
- Measures of dispersion
  - range, InterQuartile range, 
  - standard deviation
  - variance 

Variance is an avg of squared deviations about mean.
Standard Deviation is the squared root of variance.

Skewness
- Measure the symmetry
- Normal, Right tail- positive, left -> negative

Kurtosis
- Measure of flatness.
- Guassian distribution is expected to have 0 as
- High, dept or flat, normal distribution

Normal distribution ->  Bell shaped curve, mean, mode and median are same, 
+1 sd to -1 sd 68.26% data, -2sd to +2sd ->95.44 % data

4) Probability theory

Probability - How likely something is to happen ?

Probability of an event happening =  Number of ways it can happen/Total number of outcomes

Experiment 2: A single 6-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability 
of rolling an even number? of rolling an odd number ?

Z Score -> No of standard deviation from the mean. 

# Q-Q plot - Which distribution matches your data.
